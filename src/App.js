              Create your own practice session, by choosing the distance and how many you make. Simple as that. Our app will do the rest, keeping track of your daily stats, the stats from your last 10 practice sessions, and your all time stats. Easily compare these stats as soon as you're done with your session either from our end screen, or by heading to the records section!

              Update your profile to include your favorite discs, your bagsize (how many discs you usually putt with). We use this information to create more stat updates as well as eventually include a breakdown of your putting stats based on which disc you're using. Simply select the disc you're using and we'll keep track of all your stats associated with that disc (in a future update, we're hoping to offer a compare discs section).
